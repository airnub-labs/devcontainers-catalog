# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains all GitHub Actions workflows for the devcontainers-catalog repository.

## Workflow Organization

Workflows are organized using a prefix naming convention:

- **`ci-*.yml`** - Continuous Integration (runs on pull requests)
- **`cd-*.yml`** - Continuous Deployment (runs on main branch push)
- **`_*.yml`** - Reusable workflows (called by other workflows)

## CI Workflows (Pull Request Checks)

These workflows run on pull requests to validate changes before merging.

| Workflow | Description | Triggers On |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **ci-lint-namespaces.yml** | Ensures only allowed GHCR namespace prefixes are used | Markdown, templates, features, images |
| **ci-validate-devcontainers.yml** | Validates DevContainer feature and template metadata | Features, templates |
| **ci-test-features.yml** | Tests DevContainer features (smart change detection) | Features |
| **ci-test-templates.yml** | Smoke tests DevContainer templates by building them | Templates |
| **ci-smoke-tests.yml** | Builds preset images and tests service fragments | Presets, services, CLI |
| **ci-cli-test.yml** | Tests and smoke tests the Airnub CLI | CLI code, schemas, examples |
| **ci-cli-e2e.yml** | End-to-end tests for CLI (validate, generate, build) | CLI, schemas, services, manifests |
| **ci-pr-check.yml** | Runs make check (linting, validation) | Schemas, tools, manifests, services, presets |

### CI Workflow Features

All CI workflows include:
- **Path-based filtering** - Only run when relevant files change
- **Concurrency controls** - Cancel outdated runs when new commits pushed
- **Smart path detection** - Skip unnecessary jobs within workflows (Phase 4)
- **Manual triggers** - Can be run via workflow_dispatch

## CD Workflows (Publishing & Deployment)

These workflows run on pushes to the main branch to build and publish artifacts.

| Workflow | Description | Triggers On |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **cd-publish-features.yml** | Publishes DevContainer features to GHCR | Features changes on main |
| **cd-publish-templates.yml** | Publishes DevContainer templates to GHCR | Templates changes on main |
| **cd-build-presets.yml** | Builds and publishes preset images (multi-arch) | Presets changes on main |
| **cd-build-images.yml** | Builds and publishes base images (dev-base, dev-web) | Images changes on main |
| **cd-publish-lesson-images.yml** | Builds and publishes lesson images from manifests | Lesson manifests on main |

### CD Workflow Features

Publishing workflows include:
- **Path-based filtering** - Only run when relevant artifacts change
- **Selective publishing** - Only build/publish changed items (Phase 4)
- **Multi-architecture builds** - Support for amd64 and arm64
- **Docker layer caching** - Faster rebuilds using GitHub Actions cache (Phase 3)
- **Security scanning** - Trivy vulnerability scanning (where applicable)
- **SBOM generation** - Software Bill of Materials for images

## Special Workflows

### ci-cli-test.yml

This workflow serves dual purposes:
1. **On PR**: Runs unit tests and smoke tests for the CLI
2. **On tag push (v*)**: Publishes the CLI package to npm

## Optimization Features

All workflows have been optimized to reduce credit consumption:

### Phase 1 Optimizations (Implemented)
âœ… **Path Filters** - Workflows only run when relevant files change
âœ… **Concurrency Controls** - Old PR runs cancelled automatically
âœ… **Tightened Triggers** - Removed docs/** paths from test workflows

**Expected Savings**: 40-50% credit reduction

### Phase 2 Optimizations (Implemented)
âœ… **Workflow Reorganization** - Clear naming convention (ci-*, cd-*)
âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation** - README with workflow inventory
âœ… **Self-Referencing Paths** - Fixed after renames

**Expected Savings**: Better maintainability (no direct credit savings)

### Phase 3 Optimizations (Implemented)
âœ… **Standardized CLI Versions** - Consistent @devcontainers/cli@0.80.1
âœ… **Docker Layer Caching** - GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
âœ… **npm Caching** - Faster dependency installs with npm ci

**Expected Savings**: 10-15% credit reduction + 30-50% faster builds

### Phase 4 Optimizations (Implemented)
âœ… **Smart Path Detection** - Conditional jobs skip unnecessary work
âœ… **Selective Publishing** - Only build/publish changed presets
âœ… **Optimized Smoke Tests** - Separate preset and service job conditions

**Expected Savings**: 10-20% additional credit reduction

### Total Expected Savings: 60-85%

**Before Optimizations:**
- Average PR: 8-12 workflows triggered
- Total run time: 45-60 minutes
- Credits per PR: ~1000-1500

**After All Phases:**
- Average PR: 2-5 workflows triggered
- Total run time: 10-20 minutes (with caching)
- Credits per PR: ~200-400
- **Savings: 70-80%** ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

### Running Workflows Manually

All workflows support manual triggers via the Actions tab:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select the workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch and click "Run workflow"

### Testing Locally

Some workflows can be tested locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Test a PR workflow
act pull_request --workflows .github/workflows/ci-smoke-tests.yml

# Test a push workflow
act push --workflows .github/workflows/cd-publish-features.yml
```

## Workflow Dependencies

### Common Dependencies

Most workflows depend on:
- **actions/checkout@v4** - Check out repository code
- **actions/setup-node@v4** - Set up Node.js (version 24)
- **docker/setup-qemu-action@v3** - Multi-arch build support
- **docker/setup-buildx-action@v3** - Docker buildx for multi-platform builds
- **docker/login-action@v3** - Authenticate to GHCR

### DevContainer CLI

Multiple workflows install the DevContainer CLI:
- **Version 0.80.1** - Used for validation and publishing
- **Latest** - Used for testing and smoke tests

## Concurrency Strategy

All PR workflows use this concurrency configuration:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

This ensures:
- Only one run per workflow per PR
- New commits cancel old runs automatically
- Different PRs don't interfere with each other

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running

Check if:
1. The changed files match the path filters
2. Branch protection rules require the workflow
3. Workflow file has correct syntax (run yamllint)

### Workflow Failing

Common issues:
1. **Path reference errors** - Workflow file paths updated after rename
2. **Concurrency conflicts** - Multiple workflows competing for resources
3. **Permission errors** - Check workflow permissions in job definition

### Credit Consumption

Monitor credit usage:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Billing â†’ Actions usage
2. Check which workflows consume most credits
3. Review path filters to ensure optimal triggering
4. Consider running expensive tests less frequently

## Contributing

When adding new workflows:

1. **Use the naming convention**:
   - CI workflows: `ci-{description}.yml`
   - CD workflows: `cd-{description}.yml`
   - Reusable: `_{description}.yml`

2. **Include path filters**:
   ```yaml
   on:
     pull_request:
       paths:
         - 'relevant/path/**'
   ```

3. **Add concurrency controls**:
   ```yaml
   concurrency:
     group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
     cancel-in-progress: true
   ```

4. **Update this README** with workflow description

5. **Test locally** before pushing (if possible with act)
