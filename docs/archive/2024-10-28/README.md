> 📚 Documents from October 28, 2024

**Theme:** Older architectural patterns superseded by current MVP strategy

**Status:** Phase 1 (Structure Created) - Documents will be archived here in Phase 2

---

## Planned Documents

This directory will contain:

| Document | Reason | See Instead |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `workspace-architecture-0.md` | Superseded by MVP strategy | [docs/mvp/](../../mvp/) |
| `workspace-architecture-1.md` | Superseded by MVP strategy | [docs/mvp/](../../mvp/) |
| `catalog-architecture.md` | To be consolidated | [docs/architecture/catalog-design.md](../../architecture/catalog-design.md) |
| `devcontainer-spec-alignment.md` | Superseded (marked LEGACY) | [docs/architecture/spec-alignment.md](../../architecture/spec-alignment.md) |

**Context:** These documents from late October 2024 described earlier approaches to workspace organization and catalog architecture. They were superseded when the team adopted the current MVP-focused, education-agnostic strategy detailed in `docs/mvp/`.

---

**Current Status:** Directory structure created. Documents will be moved with archive headers in Phase 2 of the documentation reorganization.

For archive overview, see [docs/archive/README.md](../README.md).
