# Documentation Improvement Plan (REVISED)

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** Proposed - Reflects Current MVP Architecture
**Overall Goal:** Organize documentation to reflect current strategic direction and catalog's role as education-agnostic generator

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing commit timestamps and content, the **mvp-launch/** directory (updated Oct 30-31, Nov 1) contains the **MOST RECENT architectural thinking** and should be **promoted**, not archived. The workspace-architecture docs (Oct 28) represent **older patterns** that should be reconsidered.

**Key Insight:** The catalog is an **education-agnostic generator/library**, NOT a platform. All persistence and orchestration lives in **comhrá** (the SaaS platform).

**Critical Documents to Preserve:**
- `docs/mvp-launch/` - **CURRENT** MVP strategy (promote!)
- `docs/services.md`, `docs/cli-devc.md` - Recently updated (Oct 30-31)
- `docs/manifest-contract.md` - Current contract

**Legacy Documents to Consider:**
- `docs/workspace-architecture-0.md`, `docs/workspace-architecture-1.md` - Oct 28, older "meta-workspace" pattern
- `docs/devcontainer-spec-alignment.md` - Marked as legacy
- `docs/CATALOG-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Oct 28, may be superseded

---

## Timeline Analysis

### Most Recent (Nov 1, 2025)
- `docs/sidecars-health.md`
- `docs/mvp-launch/coding-agent-prompt-sdk-codespaces-adapter.md`

### Recent (Oct 30-31, 2025) - CURRENT ARCHITECTURE
- **`docs/mvp-launch/`** - All files (MVP strategy, separation of concerns, dev environments)
- `docs/services.md`, `docs/cli-devc.md`, `docs/STACKS.md`
- `docs/classroom-fast-start.md`, `docs/manifest-contract.md`
- `docs/saas-edu-platform-vision.md` (updated Oct 31)

### Older (Oct 28-29, 2025) - POTENTIALLY LEGACY
- `docs/workspace-architecture-0.md`, `docs/workspace-architecture-1.md`
- `docs/CATALOG-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/devcontainer-spec-alignment.md` (marked legacy)
- `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/MIGRATION*.md`

---

## Current Architecture Understanding

### From mvp-launch/ (AUTHORITATIVE)

**1. Catalog Role (separation-of-concerns-devcontainers-vs-comhra.md)**
- devcontainers-catalog = **education-agnostic, stateless generator**
- NO database, NO persistence, NO platform logic
- Generates `manifest.json` that comhrá (SaaS) consumes
- Reusable by ANY platform (education, internal teams, hackathons, CI)

**2. MVP Strategy (mvp-launch-plan.md)**
- Repo-button first (no CodespacesAdapter required initially)
- Adapter-ready architecture for future
- Focus on government funding (iPad/Chromebook access)
- Phase 0: MVP (repo generation, Codespaces button, sidecars)
- Phase 1-4: Incremental adapter additions

**3. Provider Strategy (dev-environments-strategy.md)**
- Provider-agnostic from day one
- Codespaces-first for universal access
- DevPod later for "run anywhere" (Docker/K8s/VMs/AWS)
- Own control plane as future option (Dev Containers CLI + openvscode-server)

**4. Experimental Services Policy (experimental-services-policy.md)**
- Services tagged: `experimental | stable | deprecated`
- Opt-in via `--include-experimental` flag
- Graduation checklist for moving experimental → stable

**5. Lesson Scaffolding (lesson-scaffolding-enablement-plan.md)**
- SDK mode for programmatic generation
- Well-known lesson onboarding slots
- Merge helpers for devcontainer.json and compose
- Port allocator with UDP awareness

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### 1. **Promote mvp-launch/** (was incorrectly marked for archive)
- **Original plan:** Archive as "MVP-specific docs"
- **Revised:** Rename to `docs/mvp/` and treat as **CURRENT strategic direction**
- **Reason:** Updated Oct 30-31, contains authoritative architecture

### 2. **Archive workspace-architecture docs** (was incorrectly kept)
- **Original plan:** Consolidate workspace-architecture-0 + 1
- **Revised:** Move to archive (Oct 28, older meta-workspace pattern)
- **Reason:** Not referenced in recent MVP docs; represents older thinking

### 3. **Emphasize Separation of Concerns**
- **Original plan:** Buried in architecture
- **Revised:** Prominently place `separation-of-concerns.md` in architecture/
- **Reason:** CRITICAL principle that catalog is education-agnostic

### 4. **Keep saas-edu-platform-vision.md as Vision Context**
- **Original plan:** Refactor and reduce from 5000 lines
- **Revised:** Keep in `vision/` as strategic context (not implementation)
- **Reason:** Updated Oct 31; provides important context but shouldn't drive implementation

### 5. **Promote Experimental Services Policy**
- **Original plan:** Not prominently featured
- **Revised:** Keep in `docs/mvp/experimental-services-policy.md`
- **Reason:** Current governance strategy for service stability

---

## Consolidation Actions (Revised)

### Action 1: Promote MVP Docs
**Input:** `docs/mvp-launch/*`
**Output:** `docs/mvp/*` (with sub-directory for coding prompts)
**Rationale:** These are CURRENT strategy, not artifacts

### Action 2: Archive Meta-Workspace Docs
**Input:** `docs/workspace-architecture-0.md`, `docs/workspace-architecture-1.md`
**Output:** `docs/archive/workspace-architecture-*.md`
**Rationale:** Oct 28 (older), represents superseded "meta-workspace" pattern

### Action 3: Consolidate Catalog Docs
**Input:** `docs/CATALOG.md` + `docs/CATALOG-ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Output:**
- `docs/architecture/catalog-design.md` (architecture principles)
- `docs/reference/catalog-matrix.md` (feature/template/image matrix)
**Rationale:** Separate design from reference data

### Action 4: Consolidate Quick Starts
**Input:** `docs/quick-start-fast-classroom.md` + `docs/classroom-fast-start.md`
**Output:** `docs/getting-started/fast-classroom.md`
**Rationale:** Similar content, updated at similar times

### Action 5: Consolidate Migration Docs
**Input:** `docs/MIGRATION.md` + `docs/MIGRATION-NAMING.md`
**Output:** `docs/contributing/migration-guide.md`
**Rationale:** Single source for migration guidance

### Action 6: Move Separation of Concerns
**Input:** `docs/mvp-launch/separation-of-concerns-devcontainers-vs-comhra.md`
**Output:** `docs/architecture/separation-of-concerns.md` (with clear link from mvp/)
**Rationale:** CRITICAL architectural principle deserves prominence

## Success Metrics (Revised)

| Metric | Before | Target After | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Time to understand catalog role | ~30 min | ~5 min | "It's a generator, not a platform" |
| MVP strategy findability | Hidden in mvp-launch/ | Prominent in docs/mvp/ | Clear strategic direction |
| Separation of concerns clarity | Buried | Prominent | CRITICAL principle |
| Legacy confusion | workspace-architecture confusion | Clear archive with context | Older patterns documented |
| Total file count | 50+ | ~35-40 | Organized consolidation |

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Make Separation of Concerns Clear**
The #1 confusion risk is treating the catalog as a platform. Documentation MUST emphasize:
- Catalog = education-agnostic generator
- No database, no persistence in catalog
- Comhrá (SaaS) handles all orchestration

### 2. **Respect Current Strategic Direction**
The mvp-launch/ docs represent CURRENT thinking (Oct 30-31, Nov 1). They should be:
- Promoted, not archived
- Made discoverable
- Cross-linked with architecture docs

### 3. **Archive with Context**
Older docs (workspace-architecture, Oct 28) should be:
- Moved to archive/
- Explained as "older patterns"
- NOT deleted (preserve history)

### 4. **Maintain Timeline Integrity**
Documentation structure should reflect:
- What's current (mvp/, recent services.md, cli-devc.md)
- What's vision/context (vision/)
- What's legacy (archive/)

---

## Questions for Review

1. **MVP Directory Rename:** OK to rename `mvp-launch/` → `mvp/`? (Removes "launch" connotation)

2. **Workspace Architecture:** Confirm workspace-architecture-0/1 are indeed older patterns to archive?

3. **Separation of Concerns:** Should this doc live in architecture/ or mvp/? (Proposal: architecture/ with strong link from mvp/)

4. **Vision Directory:** Is `saas-edu-platform-vision.md` still relevant as strategic context, or should it be updated/replaced?

5. **Coding Prompts:** Should agent prompts in mvp-launch/ be organized into subdirectory or kept flat?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm understanding** - Does this revised plan align with current architecture?
2. **Get team consensus** - Especially on workspace-architecture archival
3. **Validate mvp/ content** - Ensure all mvp-launch/ docs are still current
4. **Start Week 1** - Structure + MVP promotion

---

## Appendix: Key Architectural Principles (from mvp-launch/)

**From separation-of-concerns-devcontainers-vs-comhra.md:**

> **devcontainers-catalog must remain education-agnostic and stateless.** It should not contain any database persistence or platform-specific logic. All persistence, cohort/course concepts, and provider orchestration live in comhrá (the Education SaaS) or other consuming platforms.

**From mvp-launch-plan.md:**

> Deliver a **government-funding-ready MVP** that proves impact (access for iPad/low-power devices, fast setup for teachers, reproducible stacks) while keeping the codebase **adapter-ready** for later upgrades.

**From dev-environments-strategy.md:**

> Build **provider-agnostic** from day one, ship **Codespaces-first** for universal iPad/low-power access, and add **DevPod** to unlock "run anywhere" (local Docker/Kubernetes/VMs/your AWS).

These principles MUST be reflected in documentation structure and content.
