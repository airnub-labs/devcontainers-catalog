# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone who contributes to the Devcontainers Catalog. We expect all participants to follow this Code of Conduct in all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and any in-person or virtual meetings.

## Our Standards

Participants in this project are expected to:

- Demonstrate respect and kindness toward other developers, educators, and contributors.
- Use inclusive language and be thoughtful about the impact of their words and actions.
- Gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Focus on what is best for students, instructors, and the broader community.
- Collaborate with empathy and assume positive intent.

Unacceptable behaviour includes:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory jokes and language.
- Personal or political attacks, trolling, or insulting comments.
- Public or private harassment, including unwelcome sexual attention.
- Publishing others' private information without permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate or unsafe in a professional environment.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of the project includes using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the maintainers listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](docs/MAINTAINERS.md). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other maintainers.
