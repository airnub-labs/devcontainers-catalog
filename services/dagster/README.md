# Dagster Minimal Fragment

![stability: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange)

> **Experimental**: Hidden by default in SDK/CLI. APIs, ports, and behavior may change. Enable with `--include-experimental` or `DEVC_INCLUDE_EXPERIMENTAL=1`.

A single Dagster web process for quick demos and classroom pipelines.

## Quickstart

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dagster.yml up
```

## Ports

- 3000 â†’ Dagster UI (`http://localhost:3000`)

## Workspace Expectations

- Bind-mounts `./dagster` into `/opt/dagster/app` so you can supply a `workspace.yaml` and repositories generated by the lesson scaffold.
- Runs `dagster dev`; provide definitions or the dev server will expose a hello-world project stub.
- `.env.example` calls out the `DAGSTER_HOME` mount and demo UI credentials for local auth scenarios.
- Healthchecks poll `http://localhost:3000/server_info`. Wait for a JSON response before triggering jobs.

## Aggregate Compose

When the manifest lists `dagster`, the generator ensures this fragment is bundled and merged into `aggregate.compose.yml`. Healthchecks gate dependent services so the UI is ready before students connect.
