# Dagster Minimal Fragment

A single Dagster web process for quick demos and classroom pipelines.

## Ports

- 3000 â†’ Dagster UI (`http://localhost:3000`)

## Workspace Expectations

- Bind-mounts `./dagster` into `/opt/dagster/app` so you can supply a `workspace.yaml` and repositories generated by the lesson scaffold.
- Runs `dagster dev`; provide definitions or the dev server will expose a hello-world project stub.
- `.env.example` calls out the `DAGSTER_HOME` mount and demo UI credentials for local auth scenarios.

## Aggregate Compose

When the manifest lists `dagster`, the generator ensures this fragment is bundled and merged into `aggregate.compose.yml`. Healthchecks gate dependent services so the UI is ready before students connect.
