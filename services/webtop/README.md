# Webtop Fragment

This fragment packages the LinuxServer.io Webtop image (Ubuntu MATE) to deliver a full desktop environment through the browser. It supports GUI-based tooling, visual debuggers, and other desktop-first workflows directly within a dev container workspace.

## Quickstart

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.webtop.yml up
```

## Ports

- `${WEBTOP_HTTP_PORT:-3012}` â†’ Webtop noVNC session (`http://localhost:3012` by default)

## Usage Tips

- Mounts the workspace into `/work` so files edited in VS Code or the terminal are available inside the desktop session.
- Customize `PUID`, `PGID`, and `TZ` to match your workspace user or timezone requirements.
- Increase `shm_size` if you experience crashes with graphics-intensive applications.
- Set `BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` to protect the desktop (defaults `student` / `change-me`) and mark the forwarded port **Private** in Codespaces.
- Codespaces omits UDP forwarding; this fragment only requires HTTP/WebSocket, so experiences remain consistent across hosts.

## Aggregate Compose

Include `webtop` in `spec.services` to merge this fragment into `aggregate.compose.yml`, giving students an on-demand desktop for GUI tasks without leaving the devcontainer.
